## **Car Damage Detection Repository Structure**

### **Project Overview**  
This project implements a **deep learning model** to classify vehicle damage using **computer vision**. The model can accurately identify and classify damages such as **Front Breakage, Rear Breakage, Front Crushed, and Rear Crushed** from images. It is deployed as a **user-friendly web application** where users can upload car images and receive real-time damage classification results.

## **Features**  
- **Image Classification**: Identifies different types of vehicle damage.  
- **Deep Learning Model**: Uses **CNNs (PyTorch & TensorFlow)** for accurate predictions.  
- **Optimized for Speed**: Processes images in **under 1 second**.  
- **Deployed Model**: Easily accessible via a **Streamlit-based web application**.  
- **Pre-trained Model**: The trained model is stored in `model/saved_model.pth`.
