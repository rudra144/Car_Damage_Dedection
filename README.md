# Car_Damage_Dedection
This project utilizes a ResNet-based CNN model to detect and classify car damage from images. It features hyperparameter tuning with Optuna, fine-tuned dropout and learning rates, and is optimized using Adam optimizer. The model is trained on a labeled dataset with CrossEntropyLoss for classification.
